# Frontend Mentor Challenges

I've found this excellent site to practice my frontend abilities.
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

## The challenges accomplished so far:
- QR Code Component
	- The very first one, it's in newbie section, but all of challenges are...well, challenging;

- Expenses Chart
	- A very cool challenge that allow user to hover over a bar and check the amount of expenses during a week;

- News Page 
	- That's very cool to practice **CSS Grid**

- Notifications
	- Nice one to challenge JS skills. User should be able to mark all notifications as read;

- Product Preview Component;
	- A small challenge, yet not that easy. Good for **Flex Box CSS** practice;

- Rating Component
	- A component where user can select a grade and send a feedback. Nice challenge to approach **form events**;

- Stats Card
	- Again a nice one to practice Flex Box, and use `mix-blend-mode: multiply` property;

- Interactive Card
	- A tiresome one! üòÆ‚Äçüí® **phew**! Great to practice lots of JS and CSS. User should be able to fill a credit card form and it must be validated accordingly.
