## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Hello!
This one was (still is) challenging indeed!
I had (still have) been struggling with CSS Grid concepts.
I am so tired from this one, that even the JS part is just functional, not elegant, not printable at all ðŸ˜‚!

I WILL improve the code for the next days, and I really appreciate reviews and feedbacks from you guys! Thanks in advance!!
