## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was difficult to settle a pattern: grid or flexbox. I ended up with flexbox for the cards components, since they aren't elements that needed quite a separate layout, just alignment. I took a peek at several member's from [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) jobs, specially [@vcarames](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/vcarames), who has an amazing workflow.
I learned (I think I did) how to use the clamp() CSS function, to adjust the main element's width. I know clamp() function is used often along with typography, which I'll do, but for now, I just want to upload this job.
